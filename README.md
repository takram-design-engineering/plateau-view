# PLATEAU VIEW 3.0<br>Design & Technology Preview

This repository hosts a prototype of PLATEAU VIEW 3.0, a part of [the 2023 PLATEAU project](https://www.mlit.go.jp/report/press/toshi03_hh_000101.html) overseen by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan (MLIT).

The prototype under development is available at [plateau.takram.com](https://plateau.takram.com). However, please be aware that it is still in development and is not intended to be a complete service.

## Background and Goal

Since 2020, MLIT has been developing and operating PLATEAU VIEW, where users can explore PLATEAU’s 3D city models and various datasets. In April 2023, they introduced [PLATEAU VIEW 2.0](https://plateauview.mlit.go.jp), transitioning its platform from TerriaJS to a CMS-based system, ReEarth. This change allegedly allowed local governments to customize and host their versions of PLATEAU VIEW.

Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that the shift to a CMS-based system mainly benefits stakeholders such as government offices and data vendors rather than end-users. For those who visit and use the system, many areas need improvements around user experience, including usability, performance, and visual quality.

This project aims to apply Takram’s design and development expertise to improve and enhance the user experience of PLATEAU VIEW. Furthermore, this open-source project allows everyone to access the design and technical specifics involved.

The design and development process started on April 10, 2023, with our contribution to the 2023 PLATEAU project scheduled to conclude by September 10, 2023.
